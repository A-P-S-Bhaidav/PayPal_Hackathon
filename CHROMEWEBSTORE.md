## 2. Permissions Justification

| Permission | Plain-English Justification for Chrome Web Store Review |
| :--- | :--- |
| `storage` | Saves the user's most recently selected payment text and recent scan history locally so the Side Panel can display them across sessions. |

| `sidePanel` | Opens the AegisPay ScamShield verification interface in the browser Side Panel when the user clicks the extension icon or uses the context menu. |
| `scripting` | Displays a brief visual confirmation banner on the active webpage when the user triggers a right-click payment scan. |
| `tabs` | Reads the active tab's window ID and URL when the user initiates a context-menu scan so the Side Panel opens in the current window. |
| `host_permissions` (`localhost`, `*.onrender.com`, `*.paypal.com`) | Connects to the AegisPay verification service to evaluate selected invoice text and issue single-use review tokens. |
